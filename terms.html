                            <p>3.A By utilising our insurance introduction services, as set out and intended in clauses 3.B, C, D, E, F, you are agreeing with all the Terms.</p>
                            <p>3.B Twig Services Limited are non-regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and are therefore not authorised to give advice on insurance products but are permitted as an Insurance Introduction Company to introduce you to or pass your contact details, upon request and including a verbal agreement or conversation, to regulated experts in the fields of insurance that you require.</p>

This is because we are not permitted or trained as an Insurance Introduction Company to give you insurance advice and can only point you in the direction and introduce you to regulated experts in the fields of insurance that you require.</p>
                            <p>3.E Our insurance experts that we may introduce to you may have privacy practices that differ from ours. If you submit personal information to any of those third-party companies directly, your information is governed by their privacy policies.</p>
                            <p>3.F Any insurance documentation that you inadvertently pass to us and which may have been intended for one of our intermediaries, for instance, for the purposes of obtaining a quotation, we will forward on to the intermediary on your behalf.</p>

Confirmation of the contract, will be accessible, upon request, if the information wasn’t initially provided in a ‘durable’ form, at the point of sale.</p>
                            <p class="x_MsoNormal">4.G Your recorded instructions asking us to proceed with the services will suffice to commence with your contract and a ‘durable medium’ statement will be read out to you, of which you will need to agree with, if you need your services to commence within the 14 day ‘cooling off’ period.

This will be reviewed every 12 months from the system delivery date and will also apply to early termination of the agreement. For 3 and 5 year ‘unlimited Use’ (Full access) subscription plans different rollover and review time frames will be shown within the ‘MOU’ (Memorandum of Understanding) Agreement</p>

                            <p>5.A Unless a specific and special agreement has been set-up, the following delivery terms apply: For any orders that we receive before 18:00 weekdays (Monday-Friday), the requested Goods or Services will normally be set-up by the end of the next Working Day (18:00 hours). If you have not received the email notification from Twig Services Limited regarding the setting up or completed set-up of your goods and services within 3 Working Days, please get in contact with us.</p>
                            <p>5.B If you have requested a specific and special delivery arrangement which may differ from above, you will be notified at the time of placing your order, or at a proximity, close to the time of you placing your order.</p>

Your services will commence automatically after the 14 ‘cooling off’ period has elapsed, if you do not need the services to start during this time.

Your goods or services will be supplied to you on or around the date that you instruct us to commence with your contract.</p>
                            <p>5.E Upon receipt of your payment by debit/credit card payments over the phone or BACS to proceed with our goods and services, as outlined within this contract, you will be authorised to allocate the Licences to your staff from your administration portal, which will be created for you.</p>
