                        <p>In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal information will likely be among the assets transferred.

                        <p>We will never send you an email attachment unless you have specifically requested it and therefore you should not open it, even if it says it has been sent by us (Twig Services Limited) as it may not have been sent&nbsp;by us.
